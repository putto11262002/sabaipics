# FTP Server Configuration
# Copy to .env.development, .env.staging, or .env.production

# Server Settings
FTP_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:2121
FTP_PASSIVE_PORT_START=5000
FTP_PASSIVE_PORT_END=5099
FTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT=300
FTP_DEBUG=false  # Enable verbose FTP protocol logging

# API Configuration (required)
# The FTP server proxies all uploads to this API endpoint
API_URL=https://api.sabaipics.com

# Sentry Configuration (for distributed tracing and error tracking)
# Get your DSN from: https://sentry.io/settings/projects/<your-project>/keys/
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=development  # development/staging/production

# TLS Configuration (optional - leave empty for plain FTP)
# For development with self-signed certificates:
#   mkdir -p certs
#   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes \
#     -subj "/C=TH/ST=Bangkok/L=Bangkok/O=SabaiPics/CN=localhost"
# For production with Let's Encrypt:
#   Use certbot to generate certificates, then set paths to:
#   TLS_CERT_PATH=/etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem
#   TLS_KEY_PATH=/etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem

# Implicit FTPS Configuration (optional - for mobile clients)
# Some mobile FTP clients expect implicit FTPS (TLS handshake immediately on connect)
# Explicit FTPS: Client connects on port 2121, then sends AUTH TLS command
# Implicit FTPS: Client connects on port 990 and expects TLS handshake immediately
# Set to true to enable both explicit (port 2121) and implicit (port 990) FTPS servers
