title: Demand Validation
description: Lightweight market validation to test if Thai photographers will switch from competitors (Pixid, SiKram, MangoMango) based on FaceLink's pricing simplicity and feature completeness. Validates demand signal before execution.

# Demand Validation: Phase 5

**Status:** Ready for execution

**Date:** 2025-12-02

**Gate Question:** Are photographers interested in switching to FaceLink? Do they value simplicity and pricing over current solutions?

---

## Why This Validation

Phase 4 established:
- **Pricing:** 3 packages (STARTER 150฿, PROFESSIONAL 450฿, STUDIO 1,000฿) beat competitors 47-76% on cost
- **Features:** All features always included (no feature gating like competitors)
- **Positioning:** "Photography without complexity. 3 simple plans. All features, always."

Before investing in MVP development, we need to confirm:
1. **Switching intent:** Will photographers actually leave their current platform?
2. **Value perception:** Do they see 150฿ entry fee as compelling vs 499฿ (SiKram) / 299-1,290฿ (Pixid)?
3. **Pain points:** What friction are they experiencing with current solutions?
4. **Feature gaps:** Is there anything we're missing in our 3-package model?

---

## Validation Approach (Lightweight)

### Target Audience

**Primary segment:** Thai event photographers (wedding, corporate, party, product)
- Currently using Pixid, SiKram, or MangoMango
- Run 2-15 events/month (STARTER → PROFESSIONAL → STUDIO tier users)
- Active on LINE, Instagram, Facebook

**Secondary segment:** Photobooth operators, event studios
- Higher volume (STUDIO tier, potentially ENTERPRISE)
- May have team workflows

**Sample size:** 15-25 photographers (qualitative, not statistical)

---

## Campaign 1: Waitlist + Landing Page

### Goal
Validate demand signal with low-friction signup. Measure conversion rate and collect feedback.

### Channel
- **Line 1:** Instagram stories + posts (photography communities, hashtags: #คนถ่ายรูป #ถ่ายภาพงาน #photographer_thailand)
- **Line 2:** Facebook photography groups (Thai Photography Association, local wedding photographers, corporate event groups)
- **Line 3:** Direct outreach to photographers from competitive research (emails/DMs if contactable)

### Landing Page Content

**Copy hierarchy:**
1. **Headline:** "150฿ to start. All features. No surprises."
2. **Subheadline:** "Unlike SiKram (499฿) or Pixid (299฿+), FaceLink starts at 150฿. Everything included."
3. **3 packages:** Show STARTER / PROFESSIONAL / STUDIO with simple comparison vs competitors
4. **Call-to-action:** "Join waitlist to get early access" (email + phone)

**Metrics to track:**
- Landing page visitors
- Waitlist signups
- Signup-to-visitor conversion rate
- Which package do they choose? (indicates tier interest)

### Success Criteria
- Minimum 50 waitlist signups from organic + direct outreach
- Minimum 10% conversion rate (5+ from each tier)
- Positive sentiment in feedback (see below)

---

## Campaign 2: Direct Photographer Interviews (5-10 people)

### Goal
Validate pricing willingness and uncover feature gaps before MVP.

### Interview Script

**Part 1: Current Pain (3-5 min)**
- What platform are you using now?
- What frustrates you about it? (Cost? Features? UI? Support?)
- How much do you spend per month on photo distribution?
- How many events per month? Photos per event?

**Part 2: Pricing Reaction (3-5 min)**
Show them our 3-package table:
- STARTER: 150฿ for 500 photos
- PROFESSIONAL: 450฿ for 2,000 photos
- STUDIO: 1,000฿ for 5,000 photos

Ask:
- Which tier fits your monthly usage?
- Would you switch from [current platform] at this price?
- What price would make you NOT switch? (floor price)
- Is anything missing from these features? (LINE + search + storage)

**Part 3: Feature Gaps (2-3 min)**
- Do you need white-labeling / branding?
- Do you need team collaboration?
- Do you need analytics/reporting?
- Do you need video support?
- Do you offer prints or photobooth? (if relevant)

**Part 4: Usage Pattern (1-2 min)**
- Typical event size (attendees)?
- Typical photos per event?
- How quickly do participants download?
- Do they use LINE or web interface preference?

### Interview Candidates (Sources)

1. **Competitors' social media:** Find photographers posting about SiKram/Pixid (positive + complaints)
2. **Thai photography Facebook groups:** Join and ask "looking for feedback on photo distribution tools"
3. **Wedding photography associations:** Directory of photographers, email outreach
4. **Existing contacts:** Anyone with photographer friends or family
5. **Events/venues:** Wedding halls, corporate event spaces often have preferred photographers

### Interview Recording
- Take notes (audio recording if permission granted)
- Collect email for follow-up
- Thank with small incentive (discount on FaceLink when launched? OR 50฿ credit)

### Success Criteria
- 5-10 interviews completed
- At least 7/10 express switching intent (would try FaceLink)
- No critical feature gaps identified
- Average willingness-to-pay >= 150฿ entry (no one says "too expensive")

---

## Campaign 3: Pricing Sensitivity Testing (Optional, if time)

### Goal
Test pricing boundaries without committing to exact tiers.

### Approach
Show different price points to different audience segments:
- Group A: Current pricing (150/450/1,000฿)
- Group B: Premium variant (200/600/1,200฿)
- Group C: Budget variant (100/350/800฿)

Compare conversion rates to understand price elasticity.

### Metrics
- Conversion rate per price point
- Which tier is most attractive at each price?
- Does lowering entry fee (<150฿) increase interest?

---

## Feedback Collection & Analysis

### What We're Looking For

**Green lights (proceed to MVP):**
- 70%+ of photographers would switch
- No critical features missing
- Entry fee (150฿) is acceptable
- Existing solutions have clear pain points

**Yellow lights (refine positioning):**
- 50-70% switching intent (reasonable)
- Feature gaps mentioned (easy to add to roadmap)
- Different pricing appeals to different tiers
- Need to emphasize different value prop per segment

**Red lights (pivot or reconsider):**
- <50% switching intent (market doesn't want this)
- Critical features missing (e.g., video, prints, analytics demanded by majority)
- Price point rejected (too expensive or perceived as low-quality)
- Existing solution lock-in is stronger than expected

## Timeline & Owners

### Week 1
- Create landing page + copy (1 day)
- Post to Instagram + Facebook + groups (2 days)

- Update upstream docs if pivots needed (see Principle 6 in DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM.md)

---

## Decision Framework

### PROCEED TO MVP IF:
- ✅ 70%+ photographers express switching intent
- ✅ No critical feature gaps (features from 2_feature_positioning.md are validated)
- ✅ Entry price (150฿) acceptable or lower
- ✅ Clear pain points we're solving identified in interviews

### REFINE POSITIONING IF:
- ⚠️ 50-70% switching intent (reframe value prop)
- ⚠️ Feature gaps mentioned (decide what to add to MVP)
- ⚠️ Different pricing preferred per segment (adjust tier structure)

### PIVOT OR KILL IF:
- ❌ <50% switching intent (rethink market fit)
- ❌ Critical missing features (rethink feature scope)
- ❌ Price rejected entirely (rethink unit economics)
- ❌ Lock-in with existing platforms too strong (revisit TAM)
