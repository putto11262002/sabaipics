# 001: Participant Flow + LINE Architecture

**Status:** OPEN
**Opened:** 2024-12-01
**Context:** [2_feature_positioning.md](../2_feature_positioning.md)
**Resolve in:** [3a_technical_analysis.md]

## The Question

How do participants interact with our system? Where does the selfie/face capture interface live?

---

## Options

| Flow | Description | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| **A: LINE-first** | Scan QR → Opens LINE → LIFF app for selfie/search → Photos delivered in LINE | Native LINE UX, push notifications, Thai users expect LINE | Requires LINE account, excludes non-LINE users |
| **B: Web-first** | Scan QR → Web gallery → Take selfie on web → Download | Works for everyone, simpler to build | Less integrated, no push notifications |
| **C: Hybrid** | Scan QR → Choose LINE or Web → Different experiences | Flexibility, serves all users | Complexity, two UIs to maintain |

---

## Dependencies (Need Research)

- [ ] LINE LIFF capabilities - what can we build inside LINE?
- [ ] LINE OA messaging limits and costs
- [ ] Camera API access: LINE LIFF vs web browser
- [ ] What do Pixid/SiKram actually do? (LINE Auto flow)

---

## Decision

**TBD** - Resolve in Phase 3 after LINE technical research.
