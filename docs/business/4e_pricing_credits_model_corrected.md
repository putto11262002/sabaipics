# Corrected Pricing Model: Credits (Not Tiers)

**Status:** Fixed - All credits equal value, different upfront packages

**Date:** 2025-12-01

**Exchange Rate:** 1 USD = 31.96 THB

---

## Our Model (CORRECT)

### The Concept
- **All photos cost the same:** ฿0.48 per photo (no tiers)
- **Different packages = different upfront amounts purchased**
- **Bulk discount = lower per-photo cost when buying more upfront**

### Our Credit Packages

| Package | Photos Included | Total Cost | Per-Photo Cost | Bulk Discount |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Small** | 500 photos | ฿240 | **฿0.48** | None (baseline) |
| **Medium** | 2,000 photos | ฿880 | **฿0.44** | 8% off |
| **Large** | 5,000 photos | ฿1,900 | **฿0.38** | 21% off |
| **Studio** | 10,000 photos | ฿3,600 | **฿0.36** | 25% off |

**All credits never expire and work the same way** - you just save money by buying more upfront.

## Competitor Models: CALCULATED FROM ACTUAL PRICING

Let me show the **exact math** for each competitor:

---

## PIXID: Per-Event Model

### How Pixid Charges

Pixid charges **per event**, not per photo. Their tiers are:
- **Basic: 299 THB** (charges you 299 THB per event, regardless of photos)
- **Premium: 699 THB** (charges you 699 THB per event)
- **Ultra: 1,990 THB** (charges you 1,990 THB per event)

### Calculate Per-Photo Cost

**Problem:** We don't know event sizes. Let's assume different sizes:

**Assumption 1: Small event (50 photos)**

| Tier | Event Cost | ÷ 50 photos | Per-Photo Cost |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Basic | 299 ฿ | ÷ 50 | **฿5.98/photo** |
| Premium | 699 ฿ | ÷ 50 | **฿13.98/photo** |
| Ultra | 1,990 ฿ | ÷ 50 | **฿39.80/photo** |

**Assumption 2: Medium event (100 photos)**

| Tier | Event Cost | ÷ 100 photos | Per-Photo Cost |
|------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Basic | 299 ฿ | ÷ 100 | **฿2.99/photo** |
| Premium | 699 ฿ | ÷ 100 | **฿6.99/photo** |
| Ultra | 1,990 ฿ | ÷ 100 | **฿19.90/photo** |

**Assumption 3: Large event (200 photos)**

| Tier | Event Cost | ÷ 200 photos | Per-Photo Cost |
|------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Basic | 299 ฿ | ÷ 200 | **฿1.49/photo** |
| Premium | 699 ฿ | ÷ 200 | **฿3.49/photo** |
| Ultra | 1,990 ฿ | ÷ 200 | **฿9.95/photo** |

### Key Insight on Pixid

**Pixid is CHEAPER for large events.** Example:
- 200-photo event with Pixid Basic: ฿299 = ฿1.49/photo
- Same 200 photos with FaceLink: ฿96 = ฿0.48/photo
- We're still cheaper, but less advantage on big events

---

## SIKRAM: Credit-Based Model

### How SiKram Charges

SiKram sells **credits** that map to photos. They claim:
- **Basic: 1,990 THB for 1,000 credits**
- **Pro: 4,990 THB for 3,000 credits**
- **Elite: 9,990 THB for 7,000 credits**

### Calculate Per-Photo Cost

**Assumption: 1 credit = 1 photo**

| Tier | Price | Credits | Per-Photo Cost |
|------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Basic | 1,990 ฿ | 1,000 | **฿1.99/photo** |
| Pro | 4,990 ฿ | 3,000 | **฿1.66/photo** |
| Elite | 9,990 ฿ | 7,000 | **฿1.43/photo** |

### SiKram Bulk Discount Analysis

| Tier | Per-Photo Cost | vs Basic | Discount |
|------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| Basic | ฿1.99 | Baseline | None |
| Pro | ฿1.66 | -17% cheaper | **8% discount** |
| Elite | ฿1.43 | -28% cheaper | **21% discount** |

**SiKram's model is like ours** - bulk discount for bigger upfront purchases.

## Real-World Scenario: Photographer Usage

### Photographer Profile: 2 events/month, avg 150 photos each

**Scenario Calculation:**

| Month | Event Size | Cost (FaceLink) | Cost (Pixid Basic) | Cost (SiKram Elite) |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Month 1 | 150 photos | ฿72 | ฿299 | Up to ฿214 |
| Month 2 | 150 photos | ฿72 | ฿299 | Up to ฿214 |
| **6 months** | 900 total | **฿432** | **฿1,794** | **~฿1,300** |
| **12 months** | 1,800 total | **฿864** | **฿3,588** | **~฿2,600** |

**Annual Savings:**
- vs Pixid: **฿2,724/year** (76% cheaper)

## Detailed Cost Analysis: Show Your Work

### PIXID CALCULATION (Transparent Math)

**Data from market research:**
- Pixid charges per-event, not per-photo
- We observed: Basic = 299 THB, Premium = 699 THB, Ultra = 1,990 THB

**Assumption made:** Average event is 100 photos (common for most photographers)

**Calculation:**
```
Pixid Basic per-photo = 299 THB ÷ 100 photos = 2.99 THB/photo
Pixid Premium per-photo = 699 THB ÷ 100 photos = 6.99 THB/photo
Pixid Ultra per-photo = 1,990 THB ÷ 100 photos = 19.90 THB/photo
```

**If event is SMALLER (50 photos):**
```
Pixid Basic per-photo = 299 THB ÷ 50 photos = 5.98 THB/photo (WORSE)
```

**If event is BIGGER (200 photos):**
```
Pixid Basic per-photo = 299 THB ÷ 200 photos = 1.49 THB/photo (BETTER)
```

**Conclusion:** Pixid's per-photo cost depends on event size. Small events = expensive, big events = cheaper.

---

### SIKRAM CALCULATION (Transparent Math)

**Data from market research:**
- SiKram charges per-credit
- We observed: Basic = 1,990 THB for 1,000 credits, Pro = 4,990 for 3,000, Elite = 9,990 for 7,000

**Assumption made:** 1 credit = 1 photo (not explicitly stated, but reasonable assumption from their website)

**Calculation:**
```
SiKram Basic: 1,990 THB ÷ 1,000 photos = 1.99 THB/photo
SiKram Pro: 4,990 THB ÷ 3,000 photos = 1.66 THB/photo
SiKram Elite: 9,990 THB ÷ 7,000 photos = 1.43 THB/photo
```

**Verification:** SiKram's bulk discount
```
From Basic to Pro: (1.66 - 1.99) ÷ 1.99 = -0.165 = 16.5% discount
From Pro to Elite: (1.43 - 1.66) ÷ 1.66 = -0.139 = 13.9% discount
```

**Conclusion:** SiKram gets cheaper per-photo as you buy more (same as our model).

## Model Comparison: Our Credits vs Competitors

### Pricing Philosophy Comparison

| Aspect | FaceLink | Pixid | SiKram |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| **Pricing Basis** | Per-photo (credits) | Per-event | Per-credit (photo) |
| **Transparency** | Crystal clear ✅ | Hidden (varies by size) | Moderately clear |

| **All Features** | Always included | Tiered (AI locked) | Tiered (credits limit AI) |
| **Flexibility** | Can use any time | Per-event only | Can use anytime |

**FaceLink advantage:** Most transparent, no feature gating, no expiry

---

## Our Pricing vs Competitors: Credit Package Comparison

### Photography Workflow: 10 events/year, avg 100 photos each = 1,000 photos/year

**FaceLink Strategy:**
- Buy our "Large" package (5,000 credits for ฿1,900)
- Cost: ฿0.38/photo
- Use 1,000 photos in year 1
- Have 4,000 credits left for year 2 (never expire)
- **Annual cost: ฿1,900 upfront, then ฿380/photo after first year**

**Pixid Strategy:**
- Charges 299 THB per event × 10 events = ฿2,990/year
- **Annual cost: ฿2,990** (no rollover)

**SiKram Strategy:**
- Buy "Elite" package (9,990 THB for 7,000 credits)
- Cost: ฿1.43/photo
- Use 1,000 photos in year 1
- Have 6,000 credits left
- **Annual cost: ฿1,430 upfront, then ฿1.43/photo after first year**

### Year 1 Comparison (1,000 photos)

| Platform | Upfront Cost | Per-Photo Rate | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| FaceLink Large | ฿1,900 | ฿0.38 | Credits roll over |
| Pixid Basic (10x) | ฿2,990 | ฿2.99 | Per-event only |
| SiKram Elite | ฿1,430 | ฿1.43 | Credits roll over |

**Savings:**
- FaceLink vs Pixid: ฿1,090 (36% cheaper in year 1)
- FaceLink vs SiKram: ฿470 (25% cheaper in year 1)

### Year 2+ Comparison (assuming credits roll over)

If photographer uses 1,000 photos again:

| Platform | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| FaceLink | ฿0 | Already paid (credits rolled over) |
| Pixid | ฿2,990 | Must pay again |
| SiKram | ฿0 | Already paid (credits rolled over) |

**Year 2+ savings: INFINITE** (FaceLink and SiKram win because credits roll over, Pixid loses because they start fresh)

---

## Key Question: Do Credits Actually Roll Over?

This is critical. We need to verify:

1. **Do Pixid credits expire?** (Yes, per market research - typically 30-90 days)
2. **Do SiKram credits expire?** (Unclear - need to verify)
3. **Do FaceLink credits expire?** (No - you said "never expire")

If credits don't roll over, the math changes significantly.

---

## Summary: Our Credit Model (NOT Tiers)

### FaceLink Positioning

**"Buy what you need, keep what you don't use"**
- Pay upfront for photos ฿0.36-0.48 each
- Bigger packages = lower per-photo cost
- Credits never expire
- No hidden tiers or feature gating
- All features always available

### Competitor Comparison

**Pixid:**
- Cheaper per-event IF event is LARGE (200+ photos)
- Expensive per-event if event is SMALL (50-100 photos)
- Credits expire (no rollover)
- Per-event billing forces new transaction each time

**SiKram:**
- Similar to our model (bulk discount for bigger purchases)
- Cheaper per-photo if buying Elite tier (฿1.43 vs our ฿0.36)
- WAIT - this means SiKram can be cheaper than us!
- Unknown if credits expire

---

## CRITICAL REALIZATION

**SiKram Elite (฿1.43/photo) is CHEAPER than FaceLink Small (฿0.48)?**

No wait, let me recalculate:

**FaceLink Small:** ฿240 ÷ 500 = **฿0.48/photo**
**SiKram Elite:** ฿9,990 ÷ 7,000 = **฿1.43/photo**

FaceLink is 3x cheaper even at our worst tier!

I made an error earlier. Let me clarify the correct numbers.
