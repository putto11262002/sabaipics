### Workflows Demonstrated
| Workflow | Steps Described |
|----------|-----------------|
| Initial Setup | 1. Download EOS Utility from Canon website (check version compatibility)<br>2. Download Pixid from pixit.io/down (Windows, Mac Intel, or M1+ versions)<br>3. Open EOS Utility > Preferences > Enable "Show Remote Screen" |
| Cable Requirements | Use proper data transfer cable ("orange cable" / Tether 2) not just charging cable; budget option: Oriio brand signal cables to avoid signal drops |
| Camera Connection | 1. Connect camera via USB cable<br>2. Computer auto-detects camera and opens Remote screen<br>3. Three key settings: Set RAW+JPEG mode, Choose file saving location (option 2: both computer and card, with JPEG-only to computer sub-option), Select folder for JPEG files |
| Pixid Configuration | 1. Open Pixid program<br>2. Go to Settings and configure upload size (2000/4000/6000) and quality<br>3. Return to Projects view<br>4. Click "New Project" and name it<br>5. Select same folder configured in EOS Utility<br>6. Enable "Auto Upload" button |
| Live Shooting Workflow | As photos are taken, they automatically save to designated folder and Pixid auto-uploads them; photographers can monitor via "Open Gallery" button to see new uploads appear in real-time |

### Marketing Claims / Pain Points Addressed
- Free software solution (EOS Utility is free from Canon)
- Version compatibility awareness (newer cameras require latest software versions)
- Signal reliability concerns (emphasizes need for data transfer cables, not just charging cables, to avoid signal drops)
- Computer performance optimization (option to save only JPEG to computer while RAW goes to card reduces load)
- Automation focus (auto-upload eliminates manual upload steps)
- Real-time monitoring capability (can check gallery during event to confirm uploads are working)

### Notable Quotes
- "Must check if the version we download supports the camera model we're using, because if it's a newer camera, we must use the latest version"
- "We need JPEG files only for uploading" (emphasizes simplified file format requirements)
- "If using regular charging cable, sometimes signal might drop" (highlights infrastructure pain point)
- "This will make the computer not too heavy in case we want RAW to go to card and JPEG to come to computer" (addresses performance concerns)
- "The Pixid program will auto-upload... we can check by pressing the Open Gallery button, when new photos upload they will show automatically" (emphasizes automation and real-time feedback)
