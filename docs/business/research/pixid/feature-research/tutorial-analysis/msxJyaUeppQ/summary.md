### Workflows Demonstrated
| Workflow | Steps Described |
|----------|-----------------|
| Plugin Installation | 1. Download ZIP from pixid.com/download 2. Unzip to folder 3. Lightroom > File > Plugin Manager > Add 4. Navigate to unzipped folder > Select Folder |
| Tethered Shooting Setup | 1. Connect camera via USB cable 2. Lightroom > File > Tethered Capture > Start Tethered 3. Create/name session (e.g., "pix Test") 4. Lightroom creates folder for session |
| Export Configuration | 1. Plugin Extras > Export Uploader Console 2. Select Lightroom folder (session name from tethered capture) 3. Choose output size (2000-6000px or Original) 4. Set output folder location |
| Method 1: Plugin + Desktop App | 1. Configure plugin to export to local folder 2. Download Pixid uploader app for platform (Windows/Mac/Mac Silicon) 3. App monitors folder and uploads automatically 4. Stop monitoring when done to prevent continuous running |
| Method 2: Plugin + Direct FTP | Plugin connects directly to FTP server (no separate uploader app needed) - demonstrated as alternative to desktop app method |

### Marketing Claims / Pain Points Addressed
- Seamless integration with photographer's existing Lightroom workflow (no need to leave Lightroom environment)
- Support for real-time tethered shooting scenarios (upload photos as they're taken)
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows + Mac Intel + Mac Silicon M1/M2/M3)
- Flexible upload methods (choose between desktop app or direct FTP based on preference/infrastructure)
- Flexibility in output quality/file size (range from web-optimized 2000px to full original files)
- Automatic folder monitoring reduces manual upload work

### Notable Quotes
- "สวัสดีครับวันนี้จะมาสอนวิธีการใช้งาน pixis Lightroom plugin นะครับซึ่งจะเป็นตัวเวอร์ชั่นใหม่ด้วย" (Today I'll teach how to use the Pixid Lightroom plugin, which is the new version)
- Tutorial demonstrates both upload methods: "แบบต่อกับพิกเลยกับแบบ ftp" (connecting with Pixid [uploader] and FTP method)
- Warns about continuous monitoring: "ถ้าเราไม่ใช้งานนะครับก็ให้กด Stop หยุดได้เลยนะครับไม่งั้นมันจะรันต่อไปเรื่อยๆ" (If you're not using it, press Stop, otherwise it will keep running continuously)
