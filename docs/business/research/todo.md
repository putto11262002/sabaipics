### Photo Monetization Feature Research
**Status:** DONE
**Context:** [docs/1_competitive_landscape.md](../docs/1_competitive_landscape.md) - Feature Gaps section

**Finding:** SiKram HAS photo monetization feature [VERIFIED - Dashboard screenshot]

**Evidence:** `research/sikram/dashboard-screenshots/sale-report-page.png`
- Sales Report dashboard with revenue analytics
- Gross Sales, Available for Payout, Total Orders, Average Order Value
- Platform Fee model (SiKram takes commission)
- Order management: Pending, Completed, Expired, Refunded, Failed
- Conversion rate tracking

**Docs updated:**
- [x] docs/1_competitive_landscape.md - Added to Differentiator Features
- [x] docs/1_competitive_landscape/deep_dives/sikram.md - Added to Feature Set

**Follow-up research needed:**
- [x] What is SiKram's commission/platform fee percentage? → **10%** [VERIFIED - Shark Tank video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmc-ST51euM&t=91s]
- [x] Does Pixid have similar feature? → NO (not found in research)
- [x] MangoMango per-photo pricing → CLARIFIED: Photo quota model (organizer pays MangoMango). S/M/L/XL packages. NOT participant-pays monetization. Parent company thai.run may have participant-pays for running events [DEFER TO PHASE 3]
