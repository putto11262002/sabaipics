title: Initial Concept
description: Raw vision for event photo distribution platform and Fast Follower strategic approach. Unvalidated assumptions to be tested in subsequent phases.

# Concept

## What we want to build
- Two-sided platform connecting event photographers with attendees seeking their photos
- Photographer workflow: Seamless synchronization and upload of event photos
- Attendee workflow: Fast, intuitive photo discovery and retrieval
- Core value proposition: Minimize time-to-distribution while maximizing simplicity

## High-Level Strategy (Fast Follower + Drop-in Replacement)

### Market validation
- Established competitors confirm demand [VALIDATED]
- Current solutions are costly or feature-bloated [VALIDATED in 1_competitive_landscape.md]
- Opportunity for differentiation on execution and price [VALIDATED in 2_feature_positioning.md]

### Core approach
- Adopt proven feature sets from existing players
- Match existing photographer workflows - they shouldn't change how they work
- Compete on superior user experience and pricing simplicity
- Prioritize simplicity and speed over complexity

### Switching dynamics
- Lock-in is low: event-based usage model means photographers and organizers select platforms per-event rather than committing to long-term storage
- Platform primarily used during and immediately post-event (days to months)
- No data migration barriers or workflow dependencies beyond single event cycle
- Low friction cuts both ways: competitors cannot retain customers through lock-in, making switchers our primary addressable market
- We must compete on per-event value
- Target existing users of competing tools with smoother experience and lower cost
