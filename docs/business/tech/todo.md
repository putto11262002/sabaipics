# Phase 3a: Technical Analysis - Working TODO

## Approach

1. **Inputs** → Feature set + business strategy
2. **Define** → Optimization criteria (what we optimize for)
3. **Decompose** → System components (grouped by function/optimization)
4. **Options** → Tech choices per component
5. **Research** → Delegate unknowns to agents
6. **Decide** → Lock in tech stack

## TODO

### Step 1: Define Optimization Criteria
- [ ] Review feature set from 2_feature_positioning.md
- [ ] Reflect on business strategy (fast-follower, drop-in replacement)
- [ ] Define what we optimize for (cost? speed-to-market? scalability?)

### Step 2: System Component Breakdown
- [ ] Identify major system components
- [ ] Group by: shared functionality / optimization pattern / tech domain
- [ ] Output: Component map with responsibilities

### Step 3: Tech Options per Component
- [ ] For each component, list tech options
- [ ] Mark: Can decide now (experience) vs. Needs research

### Step 4: Research Tasks
- [ ] Define research questions
- [ ] Delegate to agents
- [ ] Collect reports

### Step 5: Decisions
- [ ] Review research reports
- [ ] Make tech decisions per component
- [ ] Document rationale

### Step 6: Critical Path Deep Dive
- [ ] Identify critical/risky components
- [ ] POC if needed
- [ ] Resolve deferred decisions (log/001 - LINE architecture)

### Step 7: Final Output
- [ ] Produce 3a_technical_analysis.md
