## Goal

Provide project-independent Hono patterns and “how-to” references.

## Patterns

- Server-side RPC definition (trigger: adding an RPC-style endpoint with boundary validation): `./hono/server-side-rpc-definition.md`
- Client RPC usage (trigger: consuming an RPC-style endpoint with consistent error handling): `./hono/client-rpc-usage.md`
