Audience

- Secondary: studios / photobooth operators with high volume and tight turnaround.

Key promises

- Easy UI/UX: made for working photographers and organizers (fast, minimal steps, clear status).
- Fast time-to-gallery: get photos in quickly; participants/attendees can start finding themselves sooner.
- Affordable: low starting price; transparent; avoids feature-gated tiers.

Core differentiator to highlight: Getting photos into SabaiPics is easy
The landing page should clearly show the 4 ingestion paths and communicate that photographers can keep their existing workflow.

Ingestion methods (must be shown as 4 equal options)

1. iOS app + camera WiFi connection
   - Connect camera via WiFi.
   - Transfer photos into event automatically / continuously.
   - Best for on-site speed.

2. Browser upload
   - Drag & drop from laptop.
   - Good for quick batches.

3. Desktop uploader
   - Stable bulk uploads for large events.
   - Designed for long-running uploads and big folders.

4. Lightroom auto-export plugin
   - Keep editing in Lightroom.
   - Auto-export uploads as you edit/deliver.
   - Best for "edit -> deliver" continuous workflow.

Supporting value props (use as feature blocks)

- AI face search: participants can find their photos fast.
- QR-based access: easy distribution at events.
- Built for Thailand: LINE-friendly distribution (where applicable).
- Reliability: professional delivery, not "random file sharing".

What to emphasize (by audience)

- For photographers: multiple upload options (no workflow change), speed to delivery, fair pricing.
- For organizers: QR/link sharing, fewer "send me my photos" messages, attendee experience (face search).

Tone / voice

- Photographer-first, practical, confident.
- Avoid corporate buzzwords; use workflow language (shoot, upload, cull, edit, deliver).
- Simple Thai-friendly phrasing when localized; keep English copy plain and direct.

Copy building blocks (draft, adjust later)

- Headline options:
  - "The easiest way to deliver event photos"
  - "From camera to gallery-without the headache"
  - "Upload your way. Deliver fast. Pay fairly."
- Subhead options:
  - "Connect via iOS + WiFi, upload from your browser, bulk upload on desktop, or auto-export from Lightroom. Then let guests find themselves."
  - "Four upload options that fit real photography workflows-plus face search for instant discovery."

Product terms (use consistently)

- iOS app
- Camera WiFi connection
- Browser upload
- Desktop uploader
- Lightroom auto-export plugin
- AI face search
- Event gallery
- QR code
- LINE integration (where applicable)

Notes / open items

- Final CTA depends on launch stage (waitlist vs paid signup vs demo).
- Confirm exact naming: "Desktop uploader" vs "Uploader app" and "Lightroom plugin" branding.
